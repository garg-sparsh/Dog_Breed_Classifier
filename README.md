# Dog_Breed_Classifier
Classification of the breed of a dog under 120 different dog breeds 

Packages Used:
Python-3.6
Keras
Tensorflow
Numpy

Implementation of Classifier with the help of imagenet and further trained on the basis of 120 different breeds of dogs 
over 10K images and validated on over 10K images.

Used Inception V3 model and further tune it on fully connected node to increase the accuracy

You can get the dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

Steps to follow:
1. First we need to categorize the training data on the basis of dog breeds by putting all the images of particular breed in one folder, hence we'll have 120 folders
2. Then trained the data by usingg imagenet and InceptionV3 to focus the model on the breeds
3. Evalaute the model on test set
